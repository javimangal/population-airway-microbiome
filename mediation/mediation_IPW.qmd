The summary of criticisms to the paper and rationale for the following analyses are summarized in the [powerpoint presentation](mediation/2024-04-12_Seminar-Mediation-Javier.pptx) contained in the *mediation* directory.

## DAG

The following directed acyclic graph (DAG) was reconstructed based on assumptions available in the paper for the construction of regression models in mediation analyses, by using the [DAGitty website](https://www.dagitty.net/). THe DAG is saved and sourced from the accompanying script ***DAG.r***

```{r}
# load Directed Acyclic Graph ============================================

source("scripts/DAG.r")
plot(DAG)
```

## Testing of conditional independencies in DAG:

This procedure was performed as suggested in [this article](https://doi.org/10.1002/cpz1.45).

Implied conditional independencies:

```{r}
impliedConditionalIndependencies(DAG)
```

```{r}
source("scripts/correlation_matrix.r")
```

```{r}
correlations
```

```{r}
localtests <- localTests(
  DAG, 
  sample.cov = correlations,
  sample.nobs=nrow( subsetcondit ) 
  )

localtests
```

Local tests results plot:

```{r}
#| include: false
png(filename=paste0(figfolder,"/conditional_independencies_original.png"),
    width=8, height=5, units="in", res=300)
plotLocalTestResults(localtests)
dev.off()
```

```{r}
plotLocalTestResults(localtests)
```

I updated the DAG according to the procedure described by [Ankan, 2021](https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/cpz1.45).

```{r}
source("scripts/updated_DAG.r")
plot(DAG_updated)
```

```{r}
localtests <- localTests(
  DAG_updated, 
  sample.cov = correlations,
  sample.nobs=nrow( subsetcondit ) 
  )

localtests
```

Local tests results plot:

```{r}
#| include: false
png(filename=paste0(figfolder,"/conditional_independencies_updated.png"),
    width=8, height=5, units="in", res=300)
plotLocalTestResults(localtests)
dev.off()
```

```{r}
plotLocalTestResults(localtests)
```

```{r}
#| include: false 
rm(DAG,DAG_updated,correlations,localtests)

# Biofuel

```{r}

### Inverse probability weights

Weights for exposure:

```{r}

  biofuel, 
  method = "npcbps",
  over = FALSE)$weights
